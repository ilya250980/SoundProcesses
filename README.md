## building

SoundProcesses builds with sbt against Scala 2.12, 2.13, Dotty (JVM), and Scala 2.13 (JS).
The last version to support Scala 2.11 was 3.31.0.
The dependencies should be downloaded automatically from Maven Central repository.

The Scala.js support it is still in experimental stage.
Linker errors and bugs are to be expected here.

## linking

The following sub-modules are available:

    "de.sciss" %% "lucre-synth"             % v  // transactional layer for ScalaCollider
    "de.sciss" %% "soundprocesses-core"     % v  // everything but views and compiler
    "de.sciss" %% "soundprocesses-views"    % v  // common swing views
    "de.sciss" %% "soundprocesses-compiler" % v  // compiler integration

The current version `v` is `"4.7.4"`.

## usage

Project is still sparse, however
there is a graphical front-end [Mellite](https://www.sciss.de/mellite), and
the Mellite website contains [tutorials on SoundProcesses](https://www.sciss.de/mellite/tut_soundprocesses1.html).

## notes

- currently, constant `Expr` object do carry 
  an `id` and thus are **not identical to each other** when created repeatedly even with the same 
  peer constant. This was done in order to satisfy `Obj` property, e.g. for any `IntObj` including 
  its constants. A future version may go back to 'cheap' constants which must be explicitly lifted 
  if one wants to access `attr` on them.

## Scala.js

The following abstractions are currently not supported

- `Bounce`
- (`Ex`) `Sys.Process`, `Sys.Exit`, `AudioFileSpec.Read`
